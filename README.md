# Hey there! I'm Maximiliano Rinaldi 🙋‍♂️

### 🚀 Frontend Developer in progress | Lover of sleek interfaces and clean code ✨

## A little about me

I'm from **Uruguay** 🇺🇾, and I've been diving into the frontend development world for **7 months** now. I've spent countless hours tweaking **HTML**, wrestling with **CSS**, and slowly falling in love (sometimes getting frustrated) with **JavaScript**. Right now, I’m all about **React**, which is making web development feel like a whole new game.

I’m a self-taught developer who learns best by doing. My favorite way to understand something is to roll up my sleeves, jump into the code, and start building. If things break, I fix them and learn from it (although sometimes after a good session of Googling 😅).

---

## 🛠️ What I’m comfortable with (and always improving):

- **HTML & CSS** (I like to make things look good)
- **JavaScript** (the brain behind everything)
- **React** (learning how to do magic with components)
- **Git & GitHub** (keeping track of my progress and sharing what I build)

## 🚧 Projects I'm proud of:

### 🎨 [Random Color Game](#)

A simple but fun app that generates random hex colors for you to guess. **React** helped me bring this little idea to life.

### 📝 [To-Do List App](#)

Yeah, I know, it's a classic... but this project taught me a ton about **state management** and making sure a to-do list works smoothly (or at least most of the time!).

---

## 💡 What I'm learning right now:

- **Advanced React**: Hooks, Context, and all that stuff that seems scary at first but turns out to be super useful.
- How to make my projects look less like homework and more like things someone would actually want to use (it's all about progress!).

---

## 🎯 My goals

- To become a **professional frontend developer** (that’s the plan 💪).
- Build bigger, more fun, and more useful projects.
- And why not… collaborate with others on **open-source projects** and learn from the community.
