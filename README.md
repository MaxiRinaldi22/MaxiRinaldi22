## About me

I’ve been diving into **frontend development** for **7 months**, learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Currently, I’m focused on **React** and enjoying every bit of the journey. I learn by building, breaking things, and fixing them—Google is my best friend for that 😅. Oh, and I also hold an **FCE diploma** from **Anglia**, so feel free to reach out in English or Spanish!

## What I work with:

- **HTML & CSS**: Crafting responsive and clean designs
- **Tailwind**: Streamlining styling with utility-first framework
- **JavaScript & React**: Adding life to web applications
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

## Projects:

### 🎨 [Currency Conversion](https://github.com/MaxiRinaldi22/CurrencyConvertor)
A React app that converts the currencies of the main countries using an API to have the currencies in real time.

### 📝 [Lucky Mines](https://github.com/MaxiRinaldi22/lucky-mines)
A game inspired by the popular mines game from the Stake casino. In this version, players must uncover tiles without hitting a mine to win.

---

## Goals:

- Keep improving my React skills.
- Build bigger and better projects.
- Collaborate with others and contribute to open-source.
